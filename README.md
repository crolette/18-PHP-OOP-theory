## Introduction

A programming paradigm is a style, or “way”, of approaching a problem to come up with a solution. The two main paradigms in PHP are **procedural** and **object-oriented**.

No one programming paradigm solves every programming problems, but the more you know about different paradigms, the better prepared you’ll be to choose the right tool for the job, and write cleaner and more organized code.

> :spaghetti: Bad / “spaghetti code” that weaves all over your application and is complicated to follow, can be written in any paradigm, including OOP.

## OOP Definition

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is a type of programming language principle that helps in building complex, reusable web applications. That allows developers to group similar tasks into containers called `classes` wich allows to create `objects`.

For example, in the real world, a `class` could be an auto factory and autos produced the `objects` instantiated.

## The Why

- Sooner rather than later, you’ll have to work with object-oriented code.
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Frameworks
- Contributing to open source software.
- Gives you various ways to think and solve problems.
- More easily translate your programming skills into other Object-Oriented languages.
- Become a more valuable developer.

## Tenets of Object-Oriented Programming

1. The DRY principle or Don’t Repeat Yourself. When you repeat the same code in multiple locations, updating becomes a nightmare. Maximize reusability, minimize repeating code.

2. The KISS principle: Keep It Simple Stupid. Don't use fancy OOP features just because you can. Use fancy OOP features because they have specific, demonstrable benefits to the problem you're trying to solve.

## The cookbook

Are you hungry to learn more about the OOP PHP paradigm ? I guess "Yes"...

To satisfy your hunger we will build a cookbook collection full of recipe objects and call your talent of cookercoder :stew:...

:point_right: We prepared for you a little boiler plate for this tutorial. You can copy/paste the folder `cookbook` somewhere in your computer and start to code.
